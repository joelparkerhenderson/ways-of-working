# High-velocity decision making - by Amazon

For team decisions, here are some examples thanks to Amazon's "high-velocity decision making" tips.

Decision speed matters.

A high-velocity decision environment keeps up energy and dynamism.

A high-velocity decision environment is more fun than a low-velocity decision environment.

Never use a one-size-fits-all decision-making process.

Many decisions are reversible. Those decisions can use a light-weight process. So what if you’re wrong?*

Make most decisions with 2/3 of the information you want; if you wait for more, you’re probably being slow.

Get good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions.

When we’re good at correcting decisions, then being wrong may be less costly, whereas being slow may be more costly.

Use the phrase “disagree and commit” to go fast: if you have conviction on a particular direction even though there’s no consensus, say, “Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?”

Recognize true misalignment issues early and escalate them immediately. Do not let decisions stagnate into “You’ve worn me down”, which is an awful decision-making process, slow and de-energizing.
