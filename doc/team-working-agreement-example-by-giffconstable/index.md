[Getting Tactical: Product Team Working Agreements](https://giffconstable.com/2016/03/getting-tactical-product-team-working-agreements/)

"We talk a lot about how assumptions in business can kill you. But assumptions on a team can do the same. One of the best way to preserve a transparent, low-politics culture is to keep everything as visible and explicit as possible. This applies to strategy, vision, and values, but also to working methods."
