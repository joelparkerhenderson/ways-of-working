# Adult Principles by John Perry Barlow

* Be patient. No matter what.
* Don’t badmouth: Assign responsibility, not blame. Say nothing of another you wouldn't say to him.
* Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you.
* Expand your sense of the possible.
* Don’t trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change.
* Don't ask more of others than you can deliver yourself.
* Tolerate ambiguity.
* Laugh at yourself frequently.
* Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right.
* Try not to forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.
* Give up blood sports.
* Remember that your life belongs to others as well. Don't risk it frivolously.
* Never lie to anyone for any reason. (Lies of omission are sometimes exempt.)
* Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.
* Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission and pursue that.
* Reduce your use of the first personal pronoun.
* Praise at least as often as you disparage.
* Admit your errors freely and quickly.
* Become less suspicious of joy.
* Understand humility.
* Remember that love forgives everything.
* Foster dignity.
* Live memorably.
* Love yourself.
* Endure.
