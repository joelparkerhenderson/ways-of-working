# Ways of Working for orientation, onboarding, offboarding, etc.

We use a "people" document. It lists our names, contact information, roles, responsibilities, etc.

We use a "pitch" document. It summarizes the project and its progress, much like a startup pitch deck.

We use an "onboard" document. It explains how to join our team, how to set up, and how to collaborate.

We use an "offboard" document that explains how to unjoin our team, what we do, and how we wrap up together.

We use a "wordbook" document that explains terminology, a.k.a. a glossary, dictionary, abbreviation guide.

We use a "responsibilities" document that explains who is responsible for what, such as a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) or a RACIO matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consultable, Informable, Omittable).

We use a "canvas" document that is our Business Model Canvas.
