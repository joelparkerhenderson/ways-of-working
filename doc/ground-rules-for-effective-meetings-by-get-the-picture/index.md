# Ground rules for effective meetings by Get The Picture

https://getthepicture.ca/2018/10/10/list-of-ground-rules-for-effective-meetings/

Call them what you will – meeting norms, team agreements, rules of engagement, or conditions for success – when it comes to effective meetings, it’s necessary to set up a few ground rules before you get started.

Here are some commonly used ground rules (collected from colleagues and meetings we’ve been a part of). Land on between 3-5 ground rules and after introducing and explaining what each one means to the group, consider asking the group for additions.

* Show up and CHOOSE to be present (treat this as the most important conversation you can be in and silence or put away technology)

* Participate 100%

* Everyone participate, no one dominate

* Share the airtime

* One speaker at a time

* Be brief and meaningful when voicing your opinion

* State your “headline” first, then the supporting information as necessary

* Success depends on participation (share ideas, ask questions, draw others out)

* Share your unique perspective

* Share your experience (not others’)

* Allow every voice to be heard

* Be generative and use “Yes…and” thinking (not, “Yes…but”)

* Listen to understand

* Listen with care instead of “building your story”

* Meaning is in the listener

* Listen from the “We” but speak from the “I”

* Respect each others’ thinking and value their contributions

* Listen for understanding – inquire (ask) before you advocate (persuade)

* Be aware of meaningless abstraction

* Treat everything you hear as an opportunity to learn and grow

* Articulate hidden assumptions

* Challenge cherished beliefs

* Seek common ground and understanding (not problems and conflict)

* Disagree without being disagreeable

* Remember responsibility and non-defensiveness

* Speak honestly

* Use I statements

* Seek unity (not separation)

* Be positive, non-judgmental and open to new ideas

* Speak your truth, without blame or judgment

* Be intrigued by the difference you hear

* Expect to be surprised

* All ideas are valid

* Critique ideas, not people

* Stay open to new ways of doing things

* Ask “what’s possible?” not “what’s wrong”? Keep asking

* Listen for the future to emerge

* Stay at the strategic level (out of the operational)

* With transformation, expect anxiety

* Let go of the outcome

* Manage group work

* Staying on schedule is everyone’s responsibility; honor time limits

* Stay out of the weeds and the swamps

* Confidentiality (whatever is said/written in the room stays in the room)

* Bring your humor and have fun!

Once you set your meeting guidelines, be sure that all of your participants are
aware of your expectations. A great way to keep them reminded, without saying a
word, is to use a visual agenda. That way you have a graphic reference of the
ground rules in plain view where they can help the group regulate themselves.
