# Rules of the Road by Jerry Perenchio

The “Rules of the Road” as told by Jerry Perenchio and as published in The Wall Street Journal:

* Stay clear of the press. No interviews, no panels, no speeches, no comments. Stay out of the spotlight — it fades your suit.
* No nepotism, no hiring of friends.
* Never rehire anyone.
* Hire people smarter and better than you. Delegate responsibilities to them. Doing so will make your job easier.
* You’ve go to know your territory. Cold!
* Do your homework. Be prepared.
* Teamwork.
* Take options, never give them.
* Rely on your instincts and common sense. If you go against them you generally regret it.
* No surprises. We don’t give them. We don’t want to get them.
* Never lose sight of what business you’re in. Stick to your “last.”
* When you suit up each day it’s to play in Yankee stadium or Dodger stadium. Think big.
* If you have a problem, don’t delay. Face up to it immediately and solve it.
* Loose lips sink ships!
* Supreme self-confidence, never arrogance.
* A true leader is accessible — no job too big, no job too small.
* Communication is our business. You can reach any of your associates anytime, anywhere, anyplace.
* If you make a mistake, admit it. Just don’t make too many.
* Don’t be a “customer’s person” (man or woman).
* Always, always take the high road. Be tough but fair and never lose your sense of humor.
