# Ways of Working for status indicators


## Yes/No status

A checkmark means yes.

A circle-slash means no. 

An "X" is not used for a status indicator, because it is ambiguous, and could mean "yes" as in checked, or "no" as in crossed out.


## RAG status

RAG status means "Red, Amber, Green".

Red means Stop/Failure/Danger.

Amber means Slow/Warning/Caution.

Green means Go/Success/Safety.
