## First day

## First week

- [ ] Have their manager assign any simple tasks

- [ ] Check-in with them and their manager regarding any first tasks

- [ ] Have their manager assign them their first project

- [ ] Create recurring one on one (1:1) meetings with direct managers in their calendar


## First month


- [ ] Hold regular check-in meetings and evaluate their progress after a month in the company

- [ ] See how they’re getting along with the rest of the team and whether they’re enjoying their work

- [ ] Assess and action training needs

- [ ] Ask for feedback on their onboarding and induction process
