Ensure that everyone can participate equitably, when they want, where they want.

Structure work and communications for parallel work streams, so people can work on one task while awaiting a response on another task.

If a blocker turns asynchronous work into synchronous work, then work hard to unblock it.

Emphasize visibility. This can look like dashboards, or status updates, or chat notifications, etc.

Emphasize shared context by making it explicit. Shared context can use group documents, or project trackers, or flowcharts, or mockups, etc.  Keep the shared context current and canonical, so teammates can always orient toward the shared context, rather than attempting to search across many disparate communications channels.
