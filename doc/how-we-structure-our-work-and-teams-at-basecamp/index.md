# How we structure our work and teams at Basecamp

https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-we-set-up-our-work-cbce3d3d9cae

Summary:

* We work in six week cycles.

* A cycle has 1-2 big projects, and 4-8 small projects.

* Each big project has its own ad-hoc team, typically 3 people.

* The designer on the team leads the project; there is no project manager.

* We don't track time, measure efficiency, or compare actuals vs. estimates.

* Ideas come from all over, from all of us, and are offered up any time.

* To pitch an idea, the person does a writeup, and posts it to get comments.

* The actual work organized by giving each big project its own Basecamp project.

* QA work is done by two of our people who roam among projects all the time.
