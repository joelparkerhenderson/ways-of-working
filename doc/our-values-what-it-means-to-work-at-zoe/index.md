## 1. We are diverse and build upon each other positively

We are a collaborative team working toward a common goal. We are positively intended & respectful, intentional in our active listening and seeking diverse perspectives, and we make space for all to participate.

## 2 We ❤️ to create moments of joy whenever possible

We create moments of joy whenever possible and encourage meaningful balance, recognizing our mission is a marathon, not a sprint. It all starts by us being intentional in building great relationships with each other.

## 3. Always start by understanding our members

We always start by understanding our members’ needs and work backwards to deliver delightful solutions that exceed their expectations and have their health top of mind, with a commitment to ethics, education, privacy, and simplicity.

## 4. Take a scientific, evidence-based approach

As a health company, science comes first. We utilize a scientific approach, starting with a hypothesis and seeking evidence to assess and iterate. We stay open-minded, learn from our mistakes and strive to keep improving every day.

## 5. We are transparent, especially when it is hard

By having a bias to share publicly and openly, we build a transparent culture that empowers participation from everyone. We value feedback, communicate openly, voice the truth (even when it’s hard) and explain “the why” to help each other grow.

## 6. Act fast, we’ve got your back

As a startup, speed is crucial to our success. Many decisions and actions are reversible. We are scarce with our time, not reinventing the wheel or seeking perfection and act on 70% evidence so we can learn and iterate. We encourage all our team members to take risks, change course when necessary, and go for it—we have their backs, always.

## 7. Dive deep

We operate at all levels, caring about the details that matter and being able to connect them to the bigger picture with coherent logic. As such, we are able to quickly distinguish between   “feel-good” metrics or “seemingly good” ideas from the ones that truly matter or capture the truth.

## 8. Empower ZOEntists to act as owners

We are intentional in empowering more ZOEntists to act as owners on behalf of the entire company without interdependencies and we continuously set up new systems, frameworks & principles to enable this. We also back them in their decisions, even when we disagree.
