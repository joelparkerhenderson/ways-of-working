# Family or coworkers?

Some organizations favor describing the members as "family". For example, a CEO recently told us "Our company is like a fmaily".

We recommend not using this kind of "family" phrasing. Instead, use "coworkers", "colleagues", "teammates", etc.

Family does not lay you off. Family does not provide feedback in a structured manner. Family does not discuss your performance with managers. Family doesn't make you overloaded or even give you burnout.

A real family, embraces who you are, gives you harsh truths without politics, "pull your ear" when necessary, and most definitely, family fights without the fear of repercussions.

Treat your workspace as what it is: a workspace. It's there that you can meet colleagues that can become your friends, fulfill professional goals, and get the compensation you deserve for a job well done.

When you use work as a foundation, such as a Family, your whole self resolves on that location, on those people. Your work, solely, does not define who you are! Never forget that.
