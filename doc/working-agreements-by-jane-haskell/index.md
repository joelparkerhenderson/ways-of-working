# Working Agreements - by Jane Haskell

When people meet in groups, there generally are agreements about how
interactions between the group members will happen.  These agreements can be
discussed, assumed or written down.  These agreements can be called working
agreements, ground rules, working guidelines, etc.

Effective group leaders find that the work that needs to be accomplishedin the
meeting or group can be done more effectively if everyone knows in what
environment the work will occur.  It helps provide a safe space for group work.
Often the leader or facilitator will have an existing –or proposed –list of
working agreements.  Sometimes the group will write their own.

Working agreement are guidelines that define how groups want to work together,
and what they want in the working environment and from each other to feel safe
and free to learn, explore and discover. (Haskell, Cyr & McPhail, Strengthening
Your Facilitation Skills, Level 1, 2007)

Working agreements:

* are developed by the group and determine how the group will work together

* describe positive behaviors that need to be present for the group to be effective

Working agreements are most effective when they are:

* simple and direct

* limited in number

* enforceable

* sharable with “new” people in less than 30 seconds

* are typed up and given as a handout for group members

* posted at every meeting in order for the group to refer back to them to make sure they are being followed

Other examples of working agreements are:

* Share all relevant information

* If you miss a meeting, support decisions made in your absence

* Stay on subject; stay on task

* Be constructive

* Listen to each other

* Observe time frames

* Keep to time and agenda

* Start and end meetings on time

* Take risks

* All ideas are valid

* There will be no review for those who are late

* Listen with an open mind before you speak

* No side conversations

* Participate fully

* Think creatively

* Share responsibility for the meeting’s effectiveness; remind the group of its own guidelines if necessary

* Respect and share air time

* Be brief –share air time

* Speak for yourself, not on behalf of others

* Differences of opinion are natural and useful

* One person talks at a time

* Take responsibility for what you need in the meeting

* Encourage everyone to participate

* Let group know your attendance plans

* Cell phones are off or on silent notification

* Respect confidentiality where appropriate

* Have fun
